GoodsFindr is an easily accessible source of information regarding free food distribution to the community. We created it after realizing that there is not currently any way to locate all food pantries in an area with a quick search. GoodsFindr contains a map of all confirmed free food distributors in the Spokane Area, and is intended to allow people to contribute to the map, in order to have the most up to date and accurate locations and buisness hours. It also has a search feature where users can locate the nearest locations to them based on zip code. When clicked, locations on the map will display the name, address, and buisness hours of the food disrtibutor, along with any other important details.

Our project aims to assist the many families struggling with food insecurity in the Spokane Area. Nearly a third of spokane families with childern experience food insecurity. Furthermore, many senior citizens are inelgible for food stamps, because they have been employed all their lives. With grocery prices rising, many individuals are finding it even more difficult to put food on the table. There is not currently any way to find information on food pantries in one place, and we hope that GoodsFinder can help anyone who needs to locate a place where they can feed themselves for free. 

The GoodsFindr website was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The map was created using OpenStreetMap and Leaflet. We used Firebase to host the site.
